Our challenge today is to write a program that will imitate a slide puzzle. A slide puzzle is laid out in a grid with one blank space, and the rest of the pieces scrambled. The object of the puzzle is to make a series of moves to rearrange the puzzle pieces into their intended order.
This exercise involves being able to determine logic for scrambling and making moves, continuing game play until determined end conditions have been satisfied, printing the board to the screen, and interacting with the user interface.

The basic game board may be a pre-determined size with the tile labels as numbers or letters, or you can allow for customization. A good proof of concept may be a 2 x 2 board to start.

The play area does not need to be square, but keep in mind that not all boards are solvable. In fact only 50% of starting combinations are solvable. This should be a factor when considering a starting point for your puzzle.
